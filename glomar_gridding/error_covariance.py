"""
Functions for computing correlated and uncorrelated components of the error
covariance. These values are determined from standard deviation (sigma) values
assigned to groupings within the observational data.

The correlated components will form a matrix that is permutationally equivalent
to a block diagonal matrix (i.e. the matrix will be block diagonal if the
observational data is sorted by the group).

The uncorrelated components will form a diagonal matrix.

Further a distance-based component can be constructed, where distances between
records within the same grid box are evaluated.

The functions in this module are valid for observational data where there could
be more than 1 observation in a gridbox.

    Returns measurements covariance matrix updated by adding bias uncertainty to
    the measurements based on a grouping within the observational data.

    The result is equivalent to a block diagonal matrix via permutation. If the

    matrix is block diagonal, where the blocks are the size of each grouping.
    The values in each block are the square of the sigma value associated with

    is not usually sorted by the group column. In most processing cases, the

    Compute the distance and weight matrices over gridboxes for an input Frame.

    This function acts as a wrapper for a distance function, allowing for
    computation of the distances between positions in the same gridbox using any
    distance metric.

    The weightings from this function are for the gridbox mean of the
    observations within a gridbox.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : polars.DataFrame
        The observation DataFrame, containing the columns required for
        computation of the distance matrix. Contains the "grid_idx" column which
        indicates the gridbox for a given observation. The index of the
        DataFrame should match the index ordering for the output distance
        matrix/weights.
    dist_fn : Callable
        The function used to compute a distance matrix for all points in a given
        grid-cell. Takes as input a polars.DataFrame as first argument. Any
        other arguments should be constant over all gridboxes, or can be a
        look-up table that can use values in the DataFrame to specify values
        specific to a gridbox. The function should return a numpy matrix, which
        is the distance matrix for the gridbox only. This wrapper function will
        correctly apply this matrix to the larger distance matrix using the
        index from the DataFrame.

        If dist_fn is None, then no distances are computed and None is returned
        for the dist value.
    grid_idx : str
        Name of the column containing the grid index values
    **dist_kwargs
        Arguments to be passed to dist_fn. In general these should be constant
        across all gridboxes. It is possible to pass a look-up table that
        contains pre-computed values that are gridbox specific, if the keys can
        be matched to a column in df.

    Returns
    -------
    dist : numpy.matrix
        The distance matrix, which contains the same number of rows and columns
        as rows in the input DataFrame df. The values in the matrix are 0 if the
        indices of the row/column are for observations from different gridboxes,
        and non-zero if the row/column indices fall within the same gridbox.
        Consequently, with appropriate re-arrangement of rows and columns this
        matrix can be transformed into a block-diagonal matrix. If the DataFrame
        input is pre-sorted by the gridbox column, then the result is a
        block-diagonal matrix.

        If dist_fn is None, then this value will be None.
    weights : numpy.matrix
        A matrix of weights. This has dimensions n x p where n is the number of
        unique gridboxes and p is the number of observations (the number of rows
        in df). The values are 0 if the row and column do not correspond to the

        gridbox if the row and column indices fall within the same gridbox. The
